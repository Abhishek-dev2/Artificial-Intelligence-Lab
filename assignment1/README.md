# First Assignment

**Task**: 

Given 2 coins C1 and C2. Let p, p1, p2 be the probability of picking C1, probability of getting heads on C1, probability of getting heads on p2. Take them to be user inputs. Get the observations. 

Now based on the observations, try to predict p, p1, p2 using Expecation-Maximization algorithm.
